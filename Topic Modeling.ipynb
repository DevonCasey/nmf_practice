      "Topic Modeling is modeling the joint distribution of words with documents and topics. Specify a number of topics, and words/documents will be clustered in to different topics. The more topics you specify, the more finegrained the categories become.\n",
      "\n",
      "Topic modeling is for identifying the content of a corpus and providing a way of automatically grouping content in meaningful ways. This allows you to do everything from summarize content based on relevance to a topic, sentiment analysis based on topic (is the topic positive or negative?) among any number of things. You can also search by topic.\n",

      "[NMF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-negative_matrix_factorization) is a form of matrix decomposition (think SVD) that takes an  m x n matrix (of all numbers being >= 0) and decomposes it down to  2 matrices W and H of dimensions m x r and r x n respectively where r is <= min(m,n). . NMF generates factors with significantly reduced dimensions compared to the original matrix. \n",
