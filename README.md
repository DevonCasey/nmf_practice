# Topic Modeling

## Overview: Finding latent topics using NMF

This pair exercise will use Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to discover topics from our NYT corpus. NMF is an unsupervised method like k-means and hierarchical clustering. NMF is a technique to help discover latent topics (features) in data that a human might not have been able to see otherwise.

## Goals

* vectorize the copus of NYT articles into a document-term matrix
* run NMF to find latent topics
* hand-label each latent topic by viewing which words contribute most to the topic
* explore how well we re-discovered the articles _sections_ via our unsupervised method

Exercise in [pair.md](pair.md).
